**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\\
I guess from what the mentors tell us, our project will focus on the vehicle type prediction from the given data, and there wasn't much for us to determine but I guess the most interesting topic covered in my domain is how we could make prediction about people's travel patterns from all those predictions like the vehicle type choice.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\\
I think me and my team is attempting to develop a machine learning methods in predicting the vehicle type of different household regarding the fact that most of the vehicle type choice method right now is statistic methods.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\\
The potential change I make to the approach taken in my quarter 1 project is change the method we use to make the prediction. We still didn't reach a good enough accuracy and I guess we are trying to find better ways to improve that.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\\
I would be interested in how methods like a random forest or deep nerual networks would works for the project.
